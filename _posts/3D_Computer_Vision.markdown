# How Do We See the World?  
### A Journey Through Human Vision and Depth Perception

Imagine you’re standing on a mountain, looking down at the valley below. Everything looks so alive—full of color, shape, and depth. You spot the rough edges of faraway rocks, the rich green of the trees, and how the sky smoothly meets the horizon. But have you ever wondered—how do your eyes and brain team up to let you see the world this way, so clearly and in 3D?

In this blog, we’ll explore the fascinating process of how humans perceive the world around them—and set the stage for how machines can be taught to see in a similar way.

## A Window to the World: The Human Eye

Our eyes act as the primary window through which we perceive the world around us, and it all begins with light. When light reflects off an object, it enters our eyes through the **cornea and lens**, which work together to focus the light onto the **retina** at the back of the eye. The retina acts like a canvas, capturing the image of the scene in front of us.

It’s lined with millions of special cells called **photoreceptors** that transform light into signals for the brain. There are two types of photoreceptors:

- **Rods**: detect black and white, help us see in low-light.
- **Cones**: detect color, enable detailed and sharp vision.

Together, they help us create the rich, vibrant images we experience every day.

Yes, the image formed on the retina is indeed **inverted**, both upside down and reversed left to right. This happens because of the way light rays bend through the eye’s **convex lens**.

## How the Brain Corrects the Inversion

The brain doesn’t literally “flip” the image back upright. Instead, it learns to **interpret** the inverted image as upright. From infancy, your brain processes sensory input from your eyes and synchronizes it with other senses like touch and balance.

As you grow, it builds an internal map of the world and learns to treat the upside-down retinal images as normal.

### An Interesting Experiment

In a famous experiment in the 1890s by psychologist **George Stratton**, participants wore glasses that flipped the world upside down. At first, it was disorienting. But after a few days, their brains adapted, and they started perceiving the world as upright again. Once they removed the glasses, their brains quickly readjusted.

### Why Don’t We Notice the Inversion?

Because **perception isn’t just what the eyes see—it’s what the brain understands**. Since the brain has adapted from birth, we don’t notice the flipped nature of the retinal image.

This shows just how incredibly **adaptable** the human brain is!

## But Wait... The Image on the Retina Is Flat!

So how do we see the world in **three dimensions**?

## Perceiving Depth: The Magic of Binocular Vision

The secret lies in **binocular vision**—the ability of both eyes to work together. Each eye captures a slightly different image because of the small distance between them (called **interocular distance**).

Your brain then merges these two slightly different images into a **single 3D picture**.

This process is called **stereopsis**.

Think of your brain as a real-time **VR engine**, calculating differences (called **disparity**) between the two views and generating the sensation of depth.
